# Mini 5V Pump PCB Design for Small Irrigation System

This repository contains the PCB design files for a mini 5V pump intended for use in a small irrigation system project. The PCB includes provisions for connecting a solar panel, a battery charging circuit, power regulators, a custom-built m.2 connector for connecting the development board, and a manual turn-on button for the pump. Additionally, it features an AM2301 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, two LEDs (blue and emerald), USB-C port for charging, and debug pins.
